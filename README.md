# ForceSafeSearch
Hosts file that forces safe search

The objective of this hosts file is to force safe search at a router level.  It remaps a comprehensive list of search engines to their corresponding safe or strict version.

Can by implemented by adding the hosts file URL to the Adblocker list of Tomato (or similar) routers, or any other device that can read and import web-hosted hosts files, or downloaded and implemented offline.

You can use this [RAW hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfmarves/ForceSafeSearch/master/hosts) on your router
or this [other RAW hosts file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfmarves/ForceSafeSearch/master/hosts_permissive_youtube), for a more permissive YouTube (restricted YouTube blocks comments and many other useful stuff due to poor categorization of content)
